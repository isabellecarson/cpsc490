# mhGAP Diagnostic Tool

A tablet application to be used by primary care workers in Nigeria to screen for mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders. This application uses the protocols for clinical decision-making designed for non-specialized healthcare providers found in the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) Intervention Guide Version 2.0, which is available [here](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/mhgap-intervention-guide---version-2.0). The mhGAP Intervention Guide includes flowcharts to assist in clincal assessment, and the questions and tips in the flowcharts are represented in the application as a json file.

### Patient Data and Video Links Database

The patient data and video links database is hosted on Heroku with these credentials:

```
DB_HOST = 'us-cdbr-iron-east-01.cleardb.net'
DB_USER = 'bb6c87f9bc3309'
DB_PASSWORD = 'c867135e'
DB_NAME = 'heroku_c1ea66fb35bb9fa'
```

### Patient Data and Video Links Server

The code for the server to query the patient data and video links database is located in [this repo](https://github.com/isabellecarson/patient-data-server/tree/fec7f00dd5fed67d3edade0153e080b958b85c8d).

### Video S3 Bucket

The videos for each page of the application are stored in an AWS S3 bucket with these credentials:

```
ID = 'AKIA5MSHNIMG4KOY5GWD'
SECRET = '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'
