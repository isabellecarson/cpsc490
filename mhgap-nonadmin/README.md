# mhGAP Diagnostic Tool

A tablet application to be used by primary care workers in Nigeria to screen for mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders. This application uses the protocols for clinical decision-making designed for non-specialized healthcare providers found in the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) Intervention Guide Version 2.0, which is available [here](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/mhgap-intervention-guide---version-2.0). The mhGAP Intervention Guide includes flowcharts to assist in clincal assessment, and the questions and tips in the flowcharts are represented in the application as a json file.
